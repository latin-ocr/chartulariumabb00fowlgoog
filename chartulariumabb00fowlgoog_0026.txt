the river level, enclosed by au amphitheatre 01 steep and wooded
hills or scars called the ‘Abbey Banks ;' except 011 the north side,
where the river forms a natural defence against invasions from
that quarter. Just north 01 the river is a sort 01 defile in the
hilly ground called ‘Scotch Gill,’ down which the marauders
doubtless used to come. The situation 01 the abbey on the
south side 01 the river corresponds with that 01 111001 01 the
castles 01 Northumberland, whose inhabitants were always glad
to have a river between themselves and the Scotch.¹ The great
sewer 101 sanitary purposes, which also turned two or three mills,
was an artificial watercourse taken off from the Wansbeok about
a mile and a half higher up, where 0 weir or dam was put
across. This watercourse can still be traced through acon-
siderable part 01 its length, and for some distance containsa
brislrly running stream 01 surfaoe drainage. In 0 wood near

the river it is now dry (the weir having long disappeared),
and it retains its bank of out-thrown material, remiuding one 01
0 Roman agger and losse. Near the abbey it was conveyed in

an arched conduit 01 stone about five or six feet high3 this bas
been destroyed within the last few years, together with the
original oak frame of the sluice by which the admission 01 water
was regulated. This is all thatin known 01 the abbey buildings
at present, but it ie intended that excavations shall be made in
the course 01 the present year3 andis this be done, discoveries
01 great interest may be made. ·

In the chartulary we find frequent mention 01 the ‘ Infirmary
01 secum: which 0100 existed at Waverley,Pipewell, Meaux,
and probably elsewhere. There appear to have been buildings
at Newminster north 01 the churoh, and these may have served
this purpose. At page 171 we have a grant 01 a rood 01 land 101
providing oil 101 alamp-perhaps the sanctuary lamp-of the
infirmary 01 seculare, which doubtless had its own chapel.

¹ A similar precaution was taken by the Romans in the 0000 01 the great
‘well’ 01 Antoninus, which 1100 the Kelwin end the Bonny Wator imme·

dietsly in front 01 11 011 the north 101 about two-thirds 01 its extent.
