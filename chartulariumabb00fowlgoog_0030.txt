a rose on St. James’s Day, p. 933 a hunting horse or hound,
p. 33; and a sparrcw-hawk, p. 273.

Ιι 70 well known that the Cistercians were great farmers,
and we find constant reference ιο their rights 07 pasturage in
‘various places. Sometimes it is mentioned that goats are ex·
cepted, pp. 10, 284. Wolves, foxes, and such like noxious
beante, were ιο be hunted, p. 79. Their dogs were to lack one
70οι that the lord's wild animala might have peace, p. 74. It
would seem that eagles at one time built their nest at Ulgham,
pp. l, 2. The monks' swine enjoyed stray in certain woods at
Martinmas, p. 7. They had folda for horsea, p. 183. They
covenanted to abstain from cutting turi in certain moors to the
detriment 07 common-right, p. 22. They dug marl, pp. 152,
280, etc, and conveyed it in carte, waggons, or by other modes
07 carriage. They collected sea-weed ιο use as manure, p. 55.
They probably cultivated osiers for baskets, as did their
neighbours, p. 160. They dug stone, peat, and coel, pp. 30,
55, 201, 264.1 They had extensive salt-works near the mouths
07 the Blythe and Coquet, and fisheries on the Tyne (see Index.)
We frequently find mention 07 water-mille and windmills both
for grindingcom and for fulling cloth; and in the case 07 corn-
mills the multures or customary tolls due for grinding are
osten stated, p. 209, n. Sometimes a grant includes the right
07 taking timber or brushwood at the discretion 07 the lord's
foresten 07 putting a mill-dam across a river, or of making
a road or ditch, or of repairing these conveniences, 07 drying
peat‚ etc. Such are some of the matters referred to in this
volume. The genealogist will find a rich mine 07 information
, that he may work for himself by the aid 07 the Index, which
has been made as complete as possible.

The N ewminster seals engrared on the frontispiece are from
examples in the Treasury at Durham.

No. 1 hasa peculiar interest as being the seal 07 St. Robert‚

¹ The earliest notices 07 ‘sea-coal’ are generally, as here, in connection
with larges, in which it seems to have been used before it was introduced
into houses. See ‘ The Archaeology cf the Goal Trade,' by T. J. Taylor, in
Proc. Arch. Inst. Newcastle, 1852, i. 154.
